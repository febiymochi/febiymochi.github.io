**WHAT IS A GENERAL SURGEON?? ^_^**

General surgeons are doctors who specialize in surgical procedures. Surgery is any procedure that alters body tissues to diagnose or treat a medical condition. A general surgeon is part of a surgical team that also includes an anesthesiologist, nurses, and surgical technicians. You’ll talk to the surgeon about the procedure before surgery.

**WHAT DOES A GENERAL SURGEON DO?? :O**

**A general surgeon has specialized knowledge of the entire surgical process, from the initial evaluation through preparation, procedure, and post-operative management. A general surgeon understands all nine basic areas of surgery, which are:**

- The digestive tract

- The abdomen and its contents

- The skin and soft tissue, including the breasts

- The head and neck,

- The blood vessels and heart

- The endocrine system (hormones and glands)

- Surgical treatment of cancer

- Surgical management of traumatic injuries

- Care of critically ill patients with surgical needs

**Today, most general surgeons are familiar with minimally invasive techniques like laparoscopy. Laparoscopic surgeries involve much smaller tools, including tiny cameras that let the surgeon see what’s going on inside your body. These specialized instruments mean that the surgeon can make much smaller cuts than they would with traditional procedures.**  

**General surgeons have a broad knowledge of many different diseases and conditions. They will recommend whether you need surgery and what kind of surgery would be appropriate.**

**General surgeons know:**

- The body’s healthy structure and function

- How wounds heal

- How blood flows and clots

- How the immune system functions

- Infections and antibiotics

**Because a general surgeon treats a wide variety of people and conditions, they have to meet unique needs.**
